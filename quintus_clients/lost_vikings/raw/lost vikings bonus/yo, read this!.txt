Credit goes to Zander Zoftware, for making this spritesheet from world 5, act 1 of Lost Vikings! (+ a few other levels from the game with this foreground.)

ExGFX85 = FG3
ExGFX86 = BG2 (Also this is the animation file!)

The animated lazers you see are set as tile 25, meaning that if you don't use a custom death block, they won't do anything. I suppose you could set them to be munchers, but then they'd be solid...

Anyways, credit to me would be pretty cool, but it's not necessary! Just enjoy the foreground, and I'm all fine with it!

Cheers, and stay based all of you!
