class Algorithm(object):
    """
    An Algorithm object represents a simple code unit that can be executed in atomic steps within a single thread/process given some input.
    The input can be the result of a former atomic step by the same algorithm and intermediary outputs may be stored for efficiency reasons
    within the Algorithm.
    An Algorithm usually does not own the Model objects that it works on. These are rather handled by the Experiment objects. The reason
    for this separation is that one algo could train some model and then another algo could use that trained model for something else. Both
    these algos would live in an Experiment (which owns the Model objects as well).
